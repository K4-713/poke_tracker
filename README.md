#Poke Tracker#
Chrome Extension For Scraping Monster Data

##Current Capabilities##
###Scrapey Scrape###
* National Dex on Serebii
* Legendary / Mythical flags from Serebii

###Reporting###
Natdex index, and a bunch of cruft. .

###TODO:###
Next: Scrape individual g8 monster pages. Like this: https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/dratini/
Also images, which we can totally do now!
How do we want to name these images? Maybe natdex_number+monster_name+[optional variant]+[s for shiny].png.
At some point, I will probably have to handle images that aren't .png files, but whatever.
